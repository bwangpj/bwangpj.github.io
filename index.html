    <p>
	This page started life as a place for me to share notes and other materials with the students I was teaching. 
	Over time, as several people have asked me what I was up to as an undergraduate, I've converted this page into a place
	to host the writings I've made and notes for talks I've given, both for my own quick reference and hopefully for the
	benefit and interest of others as well.

        I'm a first-year graduate student in mathematics at Harvard University. Before that, I was an undergraduate in mathematics (with a second major in computer science) at the National University of Singapore, where I completed my honours thesis under the supervision of Wee Teck Gan.<br />

          <a href="./files/MathAndMachines.pdf" target="_blank">Mathematics in the age of machines</a>, <i>article, Jan 2025</i>  <br />
These are some of the thoughts I have had for a while, loosely surrounding recent developments in AI and their impact on mathematics, but never got around to putting on paper until now. Though the original motivation for writing this article was to address recent developments in AI, the article is actually more broadly about how I view mathematics, and the role I feel mathematics plays in our world.

          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18329" target="_blank">Transfer using Fourier transform and minimal representation of \( E_7 \)</a>, <i>preprint, Jul 2025</i>  <br />
In this paper, we study the Sakellaridis-Venkatesh conjecture for the rank-1 spherical variety \( X = \text{Spin}_9 \backslash F_4 \) using an exceptional theta correspondence. We establish the correct transfer map satisfying relative character identities in this case and show that our transfer map agrees with the formula in (Sakellaridis, 2021). Moreover, we show how our techniques lead to a characterization of \( X \)-relatively cuspidal representations.

          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06624" target="_blank">Generalised Whittaker models as instances of relative Langlands duality II: Plancherel density and global periods</a>, <i>preprint, Jan 2024</i>  <br />
In part I of this paper (below), a general family of instances of the relative Langlands duality of Ben-Zvi-Sakellaridis-Venkatesh [BZSV] were proposed and studied in the setting of branching problems for smooth representations. In this paper, we show the numerical conjectures of [BZSV] for the local Plancherel density, as well as an application to their conjectures on global periods, for this general family of instances.

A systematic way to organise the interesting periods of automorphic forms on a reductive group \( G \) is via the theory of nilpotent orbits of \( G \). On the other hand, it is known that the theta correspondence can be used effectively to relate automorphic periods on each member of a dual pair. In this paper, I establish this relation in full generality, facilitated by a certain transfer of nilpotent orbits via moment maps. This is the analogous global result to the local result previously established by Gomez and Zhu.        </li>

          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aim.2025.110129" target="_blank">Generalised Whittaker models as instances of relative Langlands duality</a>, <i>Advances in Mathematics, Vol. 463 (2025), 110129</i>  <br />
	    This is my honours thesis, supervised by Prof Wee Teck Gan, on the relative Langlands duality recently proposed by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh. At the most basic level, this is a duality of a certain class of symplectic varieties with Hamiltonian reductive group action, which is expected to have implications for many incarnations of the Langlands program. One local incarnation of this duality theory is that it leads, via the philosophy of geometric quantization of Hamiltonian varieties, to a duality theory of branching problems in the representation theory of reductive groups over local fields, which often unexpectedly relates two <i>a priori</i> unrelated branching problems. The generalised Whittaker (also known as Gelfand-Graev) representations serve as the prototypical example for such branching problems.

      <h2 id="talks">Talks and notes</h2>
	These are some of the notes (only for talks I've given) and writings I've made throughout my undergraduate career, arranged roughly by topic. (Those notes that are handwritten were made primarily for my own reference, but I've included them here as they are fairly complete content-wise. One of the items on my to-do list is to type these notes up neatly in LaTeX.)
	

	<ul class=talks>


        <li>
          <a href="./files/BGGCatO.pdf" target="_blank">BGG Category \( \mathcal{O} \)</a>, <i>presentation slides, Nov 2022</i>  <br />
	    A rather comprehensive and detailed introduction to the BGG category \( \mathcal{O} \). This was a class presentation for MA5211 Lie Theory.

	    An introduction to translation functors in the context of the BGG category \( \mathcal{O} \). <br />
	    This was part of a learning seminar on category \( \mathcal{O} \), with a view towards Soergel bimodules and the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture. 
        </li>

        <li>

	    This was part of a learning seminar on nilpotent orbits in semisimple Lie algebras. 
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="./files/InducedNilpOrbits.pdf" target="_blank">Induced nilpotent orbits</a>, <i>handwritten presentation notes, Mar 2022</i>  <br />
	    On the Lusztig-Spaltenstein theory of induced nilpotent orbits, which help to reduce the study of nilpotent orbits to that of smaller (Levi) subalgebras. <br />
